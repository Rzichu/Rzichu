Welcome, traveler from afar!

If you've found me here it means there's some serious business going on around...
*or you've found one of my content posts somewhere on the net.*
If that is so, I'm glad I've managed to create something interesting.

*Who I am?*:

Just a introverted guy, trying to finally reach his goals and call himself 'happy' before the life ends.
And yeah, ya know if you read my bio lmao. Becoming who I am and feeling like myself took a lot of time.
Feeling comfortable with myself even more. We've all been there at some point.

*What do I do and why?*:

My main passions are: game development/programming, fantasy worldbuilding and video games.
As most people, I'm trying to find happiness and piece together my own ***self*** through these passions,
meet others, who think along the same or close lines as me.
And finally, just enjoy the time I was given.
